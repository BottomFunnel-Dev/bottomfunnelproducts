Electronic Security</h2>

We understand the importance of safeguarding your data and take measures to protect it to the best of our abilities. However, it is important to note that data transmitted and stored over the internet is not completely immune to potential security risks and breaches. While we employ industry-standard security practices and utilize secure channels for data transmission, we cannot guarantee absolute protection due to the inherent uncertainties involved in electronic transfer and storage processes.
We are committed to implementing robust security measures to mitigate risks and protect your data within our control.

However, we are dedicated to maintaining a secure environment for your data and continuously work towards improving our security measures.
We recommend taking precautionary measures on your end, such as using strong passwords, avoiding sharing sensitive information through insecure channels, and keeping your devices and software up to date. By practicing good online hygiene, you can further enhance the security of your data.
