              <p>
                Our goal is to create an easy-to-use tool that allows parties to
                engage with voters online in a meaningful way, without adding
                unnecessary friction or slowing down the user experience. We
                think that engaging with your constituents on social media is
                important â€“ but so is talking one-on-one during campaign events
                and community meetings offline!
