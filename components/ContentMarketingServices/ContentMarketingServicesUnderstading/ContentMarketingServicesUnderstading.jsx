                        <li>Ë At the very start of the creation process, our content creators take
                            the time to learn anything and everything about your brand.
                            Through conversations with key stakeholders across your
                            organization, we develop an intimate understanding of important
                            brand elements like your mission and values, as well as the more
                            detailed characteristics such as style, tone of voice and color
                            palettes.</li>
                        <li>Armed with this information, our content creators know exactly how
                            to position your content so that it isn’t only accurate and thoughtprovoking, but also has the look and feel of coming directly from
                            you.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Next, we go to work turning ideas into something
                            tangible. Our writers conduct deep industry research
                            using highly reputable government, news and
                            industry sources to create a valuable piece of original
                            content your customers will love.</li>
                        <li>We also conduct extensive interviews with subject
                            matter experts (SMEs) to dig deeper into a specific
                            topic that will inform a unique piece of content and
                            position your brand as a thought leader in the space.</li>
                        <li>Our designers, animators and videographers take
                            your written content and couch it in arresting imagery
                            and graphics (always according to your brand
                            guidelines) to really bring your content to life and turn
                            it into something people will actually enjoy
                            consuming.</li>

                        term Strategy</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We’re not just a one-and-done operation. Our strategists keep a
                            close eye on the performance of each piece of content (as well as
                            your overall campaigns) to ensure they are meeting the goals we
                            identified together at the very beginning.</li>
                        <li>While this is helpful in identifying what works (so we can replicate
                            successful elements in future campaigns), it also gives us insight
                            into what isn’t working quite as well. That points the way to
                            optimization opportunities to create better, harder-hitting
                            strategies.</li>
