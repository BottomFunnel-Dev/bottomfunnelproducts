        <p>
          IT teams are the backbone of any organization that uses technical
          infrastructure like wi-fi, computers and printers. They constantly
          work behind the scenes to ensure the smooth functioning and
          maintenance of the IT infrastructure.
        </p>

        <p>
          When students or staff have a problem with an IT equipment or service,
          it's the IT team that helps. At schools and universities, in
          particular, they are closely involved in the organization and
          management of technical events and competitions. Here’s how Freshdesk
          helps IT teams.

            For every enquiry, Freshdesk provides context for the person writing
            to them and the history of issues they have reported. IT teams can

            about asking the staff for more information.
