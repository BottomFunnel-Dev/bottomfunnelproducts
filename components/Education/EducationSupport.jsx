            When people think of customer support, they commonly associate it
            with companies helping end-users with their product or service.
            Support, however, also includes helping people working within a
            company. It could be support provided to prospects, employees,
            vendors, or partners. One of the best examples of a business that is
            required to support different sets of people both internally and
            externally is an educational institution.

            At schools and universities, dedicated teams help prospective
            students who may have questions about a course or their application
            status. Once an applicant is enrolled as a student, different teams
            help in administrative tasks like organizing classes, collecting
            fees and finding accommodation. Every day, classes require the use
            of numerous IT equipment and services such as projectors, printers
            and wifi. Whenever there is an IT-related issue, the IT team
            provides support to students and staff.

            These different teams that support students and staff at educational
            institutions face unique challenges. Administrative teams get
            exceptionally busy at the start of every academic year. IT teams
            often spend time answering simple questions. All in all, repetitive
            and arduous tasks for the support teams at educational institutions
            can make work challenging and in the worst case, boring.
