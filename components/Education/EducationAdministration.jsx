        <p>
          Smooth operations in any company depend on administrative teams. On an
          everyday basis, different administrative teams in a company oversee
          operations within their department, coordinate between different
          teams, and plan according to the needs of the company. The role of
          administrative teams is crucial in schools and universities. Different
          administrative teams help in enrolling students, onboarding them and
          managing finances and facilities. During busy months, some
          administrative teams tend to have an overload of work. As an example,
          teams responsible for admissions need to work with a huge volume of
          student enrollments before the start of school.

          Educational institutions that use email or legacy solutions always
          have trouble managing work, especially during these busy months.
          Delays and lapses in communication from the administrative teams are a
          common sight in even the best of schools and universities. With

            Administrative teams have dependencies on different departments at
            their school or university to complete tasks. As an example, teams
            responsible for admissions coordinate between prospective students
            and teaching staff to finalize applications. They typically
            follow-up with teaching staff and applicants on different email
            threads or chat windows before making updates on yet another system.
            With Freshdesk, teams can collaborate effortlessly with different
            departments they need help from while never losing sight of their
            task.
