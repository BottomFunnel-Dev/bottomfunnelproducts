        <p>Ponder this. A little over a decade ago, customer service and customer engagement were terms reserved exclusively for direct consumer-facing businesses. Think retail chains, clothing boutiques, hospitality chains, and such. For them, at practically every step of their business process, they had to keep their customers’ needs, interests, and behaviour in mind.</p>
        <p>Now, are we saying that such a concept was not prevalent in the B2B space? Certainly not. Yet, whether for a buyer like you and me, or another business which comes with certain requirements, customer service was not as widely discussed or brought into the open as it is today; more so, in core industries like logistics. We could say, in one way, that technology has also played a significant role in enhancing the quality of services provided by logistics companies, and as a result, companies in this space are looking beyond just providing a service. They’re working to provide quality, timely, and efficient service in order to stand out among their competitors.</p>
