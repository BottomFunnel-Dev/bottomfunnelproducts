        <p>Emails are the most preferred means of communication for sales teams. It can be cumbersome and time-consuming for a 
          salesperson to toggle between their email inbox and sales CRM to send emails and record their prospectsâ€™ responses. With
           Freshsales, you can access and manage your third-party email account(s) directly from your CRM account without ever having to
            leave the system. </p>
