             <h3>Streamline your sales process with automation</h3>
             <p>Your salespeople also go back and forth between distributors, dealers, or retailers every day. You can ease up their work by creating workflows that operate like clockwork. Automate the most common business activity without setting up a workflow from scratch. Take advantage of ready-to-use workflow templates and enable a workflow by simply clicking a button. For example, when a distributor does not answer your call, a reminder can be automatically set to follow up with them the next day.</p>

        <div className={styles.ManufacturingFeatureslist}>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When an interested dealer visits your website, you can capture their attention and engage with them using a chatbot or get their details using webforms. Now, their details are sent straight to your CRM, eliminating any manual entry.</li>
           <li>Next, with automated territory management, you can auto-assign leads to relevant salespeople in a round-robin manner.</li>
           <li>Your salespeople can then identify, prioritize, and qualify the most interested prospects using predictive contact scoring by AI-powered assistant Freddy.</li>
           <li>Organize customer data the way you want, access and manage them on one screen. Using modern views, enjoy a spreadsheet-like experience that is easy to use and helps perform sales activities faster.</li>
