            <ul>
              <li>Manually adding a lead,</li>
              <li>Importing leads through excel sheets, or</li>
              <li>Creating web forms on your website.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In fact, a CRM for Finance software also allows you to convert your sales emails into leads, or add leads after making a phone call within the CRM.

Here‚Äôs more good news: When it comes to making phone calls within the CRM, you can integrate your own banking VoIP solution, or choose from a host of integrations that an ideal CRM for Finance software comes with.</p>
            <p>Once your leads get added into the CRM software, you get a 360ùÜ© view of their profile at a glance. It provides you with</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A quick summary of all the essential information such as name, company, contact information, salesperson assigned, and more. </li>
              <li>Highlights covering a contact‚Äôs background information such as open deals, active marketing lists, meeting notes, etc.</li>
              <li>Deep dive into detailed information such as support tickets in progress, a chronological timeline of engagements you‚Äôve had with them over email, phone, chat, etc. </li>

            </ul>
            <p>Lastly, your institution might be getting a multitude of leads across product or segment verticals. How do you ensure that not everybody across the organization has access to data which may not be relevant to them?</p>
            <p>A CRM for Finance software enables you to create custom roles, where you can set access level controls for what data each user can access and edit within the CRM.</p>

            <h2>Enhance cross-sell and upsell opportunities</h2>
            <p>Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve onboarded a new customer with a savings bank account. After a certain period, based on their transaction patterns and activity history, you might find them eligible for a personal loan, a credit card, or more. Your relationship manager or contact center representative can‚Äôt really keep track of each customer across time periods. Instead, you can simply set up a workflow to send an Financed email to a customer, after a certain period, pitching a product from your suite.</p>
            <p>. Using workflow templates, you can enable a workflow by simply clicking a button or can edit an existing template to add more conditions and make it live.Alternatively, you can even set up a reminder for your relationship manager or contact center representative to follow up with a customer on a cross-sell or upsell opportunity after a certain period. This ensures that you maximize your opportunity to cross-sell or upsell, while also communicating contextually.</p>

  <h2>Nurture your customers </h2>
<p>A good CRM for Finance software enables you to reach out to hundreds of customers with customized, personalized campaigns and emails, which can be your gateway to establishing a good rapport with them, and even creating loyalty towards your brand.</p>
<p>Be it to wish them for their birthdays or anniversaries or to send them a relevant product or service emails, personalizing can go a long way in making your customers feel that you care about their interests and needs rather than just focusing on selling your product to reach your targets.</p>

            <p>Analyze deals by getting an insight into various metrics such as deal stages by product, total account value, loans by source, phone calls made in a month, in a quarter, approved loans by month, quarter or year, and more.</p>
            <p>While reports in a CRM for Finance enable you to measure your business and team performance from time to time, a dashboard enables you to compare reports such as loans sanctioned in the first quarter of the year compared to the sanctions in the same quarter the previous year, or deposits by source, compared to deposits by region, and such. You can navigate between reports to get context and track team performance. Reports can be shared automatically on a monthly or periodic basis.</p>
            <p>Accessing reports gives you regular insight into how your business is performing and what steps need to be taken to fuel its growth. </p>

  <h2>Ensure quick turnarounds </h2>
  <p>Like we said earlier, creating a great customer experience is about sustaining that quality across touchpoints within your company. Customers come back with multiple queries and requests ‚Äì they need a new credit card, they need to generate a new pin, they want to check on an unusual transaction, and so on.</p>
  <p> In such circumstances, integrating your CRM for Finance software with a support software will not only ensure that you have context about the customer‚Äôs past interactions with your company to make your response more relevant, but also ensure that you are able to prioritize customer issues and address them more efficiently.</p>
