          Bottom funnel is the new buzzword for app developers in search of a
          way to increase their user base and revenue. SaaS companies are
          quickly shifting from a subscription model to one that integrates paid
          features and benefits, rewarding loyal users with additional services
          or discounts. With 'bottom funnel saas' app development, you can
          create an engaging experience that will entice users to sign up for
          your service and come back again and again.
